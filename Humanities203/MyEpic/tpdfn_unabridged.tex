\section{Description of Characters and Obstacles}

\indent Although it is only briefly mentioned in \emph{The Odyssey} by Menelaus, the story of
the Trojan Horse, a technological marvel in which Odysseus and other Grecians hid to defeat the Trojans,
is a legend of Greek heritage that I have marveled at since I was a child (Fagles 133).
Technology has captivated me my entire life, and because of this technology, specifically the question of
whether it is a benefactor or opponent of society is the primary theme of my epic, \emph{The Propitious
Drones from Nevada}. Because technology is the foundation of the plot, the main character has an interest
in technology, his name is \mcs Ashley.

\mc, a 25 year-old, modernist architect living in Henderson, Nevada, possesses a lifelong urge
to make the world a better place and, through doing so, better himself. He is an extremely curious individual,
who will always seek out his own answers and, by his efforts, he has gained a magnitude of endurance that withstands
adversity of "luck", interaction and situation. \mc's greatest quality, the primary instance of which is yet to be 
revealed, is sacrifice. Looking at the world around him, \mcs sees pain and toil, his qualities are in direct revolt to these
problems, his qualities are his intentional attempt to solve them. \mcs will soon find that the world's problems
are much greater than he ever could have expected.

There are two main obstacles that \mcs will face in his journey. The first, as will be further described in the plot summary,
occurs by accident. \mcs must endure the desert, hiking thirstily, weary, bloody and bruised; without the satisfaction
of nourishment. Secondly, \mcs will have to face two drones (evil robots) each led by its synthetic, emulated, human
will. Another drone, called Gamma serves as a companion to \mc, as well as an antithesis to the to the depraved drones.
Gamma possesses the will of the scientist who was the fountainhead of the technology by which the drones were
engendered.

\section{Ten Opening Lines}

Alas, the soulless night-owls perch atop the globe; the very images of patriotic affluence, of beloved charity.
They need not take power, for to them we have freely given all authority, to these devils we have exchanged our very
souls for naught but the dirt which we will one day call \emph{home}.
Their clanking bones collide beneath synthetic skin, never-breaking, indifferent to the strains of time.
The spoked axle that is their heart, rotates perpetually, powered by the desire sub-microscopic slaves,
indebted to an unknowable hope. Who will make the world anew? Who possesses the ability to raze the dormant principality whose
power resides in its patience, whose war is waged in peace and whose visible love is a masked hatred.
In the world there is peace -- the night sleeps -- they do not. Their effort is dedicated to gaining prominence,
to secretly colonizing in the dark. In this epoch of emulated prosperity, who can make the world anew?

\section{Plot Summary}

As the plot opens, \mcs Ashley is driving his Oldsmobile from his home at Henderson
to Vegas. Some weekends, he drives to Vegas to practice his draftsmanship by sketching some of
the architectural wonders thereabout. As he enters the city, he sees a curious sight out his car window: 
a woman being dragged out of a casino by men wearing dark suits. He indulges 
his curiosity for a moment when, \emph{WHAM!} He crashes into a limousine in front of him. At this moment,
A few men with dark suits rush out of the posteriorly mangled limo.

Realizing the sum of the facts that these individuals do not appear to have his best interest in mind and that a
steady stream of dark smoke is beginning to emit from the hood of his vehicles, \mcs quickly bids his beloved
car's driver seat farewell, and begins to flee. Abruptly he is stopped however, seeing nothing but a red and
black striped tie as his face is forcefully planted upon the upper chest of a newly arrived, flanking pursuer. 
At this point, \mcs backs away, holding his nose to dull the sharp pain incurred from the impact. He looks
around, noticing about a half-dozen suit wearing mobster type figures. One of the aggressors shouts, "You
picked the wrong day to go joy-riding, you piece of crap!" \mcs tries to curb the easily-agitated, with words
implying a desire for passive reaction -- he finds no success. Unable to defend himself from the aggressors,
they beat him down, lacking mercy or any inclination for humane remorse.

\mcs awakes to the sound of a low rumbling, realizing after a couple of minutes that he is in the trunk of a car.
Over the sound of the engine, he makes out some of the words of a deep voice, he recognizes it as belonging
to the aggressor who had shouted earlier. "The boss said that...," \mcs hears. Then, a few moments later, "...near
the border of Arizona and Nevada...." \mcs lay back. Thinking about what he had just heard, he drifts back
into unconsciousness, this time in sleep, feeling an eccentric sense of comfort or (perhaps) just delusion. 

The unpleasant amalgamation of a creak and a bright light awakening him this time, \mcs looks up to see the face of the
distinct aggressor. The aggressor pulls him out of the trunk, throws him on the ground, gives him a solid kick in the
side and says in pure sarcasm, "We gotta special treat for you today." Then, after a brief pause, "For screwin'
up the boss' favorite limo, you get to be buzzard food." \mcs stared silently, an act which disturbed the very heart of
the mobster who had never felt such a calm as \mcs illuminated. "Well, if you got nothin' to say," said the mobster almost
shakingly, "So long."

\mcs stood as the unnamed man drove off. He saw around him no rodes, his cell phone was taken by the mobsters, but,
since the sun had not set, he knew his path -- he would walk West. He endured the hike through the desert for a long time, stopping
occasionally to eat plants he found and rest. \mcs ventured in optimistic endurance. His first thought after the mobster left
was \emph{thankfully I had a large meal before my encounters those jokers.} As he is walking near a mountain, the ground starts
shifting below him, he stumbles and falls down a trap hatch hidden in the desert.

Cushioned by the sand that falls with him, \mcs looks around at his new surroundings, seeking food and water, seeing
a dark, laboratory. The first thing he sees is a flickering computer screen with a small window open (Revelation 1). Next,
he sees a palm-sized circuit board which he picks up. The strange board is labeled "RVC No. 3" (Revelation 2). The third
thing he finds is a robot, with glowing eyes and an empty port on the side of its head, into which he inserts the RVC.
The robot comes to life and begins to tell a story of a scientist and a politician.

The great scientist, under the sponsorship of Benjamin Spade (the politician) had created a machine
that could import the will of any living organism into a circuit card known as the \emph{Replicated Volition Chip}.
\mcs had heard of Spade, in fact, there was hardly day when he could go without hearing about the increasingly
prominent politician. The, robot proceeds to tell \mcs that the chips could be implanted into drones that would then act out
the will within the RVC and that the first RVC contained the wills of many animals and the second had contained Spade's
will. Continuing, almost sorrowfully the drone tells \mcs that the scientist saw an unnatural evil in the wills of Spade and the
animals and that, in desperation he secretly uploaded his own will into the third RVC, along with the account that
it had just relayed. The remorseful drone then went on to say that the great scientist had given the drones the ability
to mask themselves as the bearer of their original will, and that they had been programmed in such a way that they
were unable to know how to download different or new wills. With almost human sadness in his voice, the drone
finished his account, saying that the animal drone and Spade's drone turned on them, killing Spade and the great scientist.
"They will not stop," the drone concluded, "Until they have replicated themselves into society with such prominence that
they can destroy it. Then they will deconstruct this world."

After the sobering account, the drone brought \mcs some canned food that had been left in the lab and it introduced itself
as \emph{Model Gamma}, saying, "Nowhere in the account I was provided did the scientist provide his name." \mcs and
Gamma (now masked as the scientist) made their way, through an underground tunnel system revealed by Gamma, to
a small town in Eastern Nevada from which they took a bus back to \mc's home. At \mc's house, they researched Spade and
discovered that he would be speaking in Vegas later in the week. That is when they decided to strike.

As soon as Spade began speaking, Gamma pointed out the animal-willed drone, now a bodyguard. Then, they sprinted out from the crowd,
Gamma at Spade and \mcs at the animal. As \mcs began beating the drone with the baseball bat he had brought along for the
occasion, he could see metal and sparks shooting from Gamma and Spade as the clashed. Bullets flew through Gamma from every side
but he kept fighting on until he arose victorious, standing convoluted over his defeated opponent. \mcs, had the advantage over
the animal-conglomerate-being, being as he struck in surprise. He also felt the surge of victory, but he also
a surge of pain, and looking down he saw blood smeared over his chest, the effect of bullets from nearby bodyguards. He fell to the
floor and his new found friend, Gamma the drone, picked him up and fled the scene bearing the body of he who had sacrificed
so much for this world.
